This work aims to construct foundation model for road-power coupling network based on Graphormer-JEPA. The pre-trained model has the ability to enhance baselines' performance on multiple downstream-tasks by fine-tuning.

This shall be the FIRST research on designing Graphormer-JEPA and its application in the Road & Grid field.

Paper coming soon...

Plz star to follow this work. Thank you for your recognition.
